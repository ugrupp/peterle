Our little oasis of calm is the ideal destination for nature lovers, hiking enthusiasts, relaxation and pleasure seekers, fitness fans, spa worshippers and open-water swimmers. As a small, one-of-a-kind hotel, we are intent on setting ourselves apart from impersonal mass tourism.

For us, the perfect holiday includes nature, fine dining, comfortable spaces and an environment where you feel at home. And we work passionately to provide this for our guests every single day.

We have close ties and deep roots in this region of the Black Forest that we have been lucky enough to call home for generations. We’re *Schwarzwälder* — the Black Forest is a core part of our identity and at the heart of everything we do. We think locally and live sustainably with the goal of offering you the best stay possible.
