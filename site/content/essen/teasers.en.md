Our menu is based on what can be naturally sourced from the local region and we change it at least five times a year. We always work with seasonal products to create new, fresh and exciting dishes for you.

Sustainability is more than just a buzzword for us. For example, we are members of a community of innkeepers focused on nature conservation. We know each of our suppliers personally and all of our ingredients are locally sourced, with a focus on quality, not profit. We serve food that tastes good and is good for the environment, not least because farming has been in our family for generations. For instance, we also source produce for our restaurant from a cousin who lives nearby — it doesn’t get any more local than that.

Our enticing wine list comes entirely from authentic winemakers, many of them small-scale, who specialise in unique wines produced in accordance with sustainable standards. Our exclusive selection even won Vinum’s 2019 German Wine List Award.
