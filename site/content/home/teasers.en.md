{{< headline level="2" title="Relax. Rejuvenate. Repeat. Welcome to Hotel & Restaurant Peterle." >}}

Visit us to unwind. Visit us to clear your mind. Visit us to get away and yet feel right at home in the natural beauty of the Black Forest.

At our cosy, family-run hotel, all our guests receive just the attention they desire. During your stay, you can really feel like part of our family — or indulge in peace and solitude. You decide what’s best for you.

We’ve intentionally kept our hotel small, with just 25 beds, ensuring a very personal atmosphere and a comfortable stay. We love getting to know all our guests personally and delight in the number of regulars who return to stay with us year after year. Most of our guests come to us on recommendation — and many of them become regulars themselves. Maybe you will, too? We would be delighted.
