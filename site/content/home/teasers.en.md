{{< headline level="2" title="Go for nature?" >}}

Then you’re right by us. We are a family-run hotel Restaurant, located in the village of Feldberg in the Nature Park Southern Black Forest. You will find cosy, individually furnished rooms, a down-to-earth but always varied fresh cuisine and lots of nature – starting right outside the door!

*We look forward to seeing you*  
*Tobias Müller & family*
