Our rooms are furnished with loving attention to detail. No two are the same, but they all have decorative touches with a history, such as old postcards, pictures of the region or pieces by young artists from the Black Forest.

And each room has its own unique features â€” a striking bathroom design, a particular wall colour, comfortable armchairs to sink into or benches with soft cushions in the dormers, offering a wonderful view of the surrounding natural beauty. Discover the surprises waiting for you behind your door!

Our small spa area is freshly renovated with two saunas and a steam bath, our in-house massage therapist is ready to take your appointment and our traditional Black Forest outdoor furniture is set up for the ultimate relaxing afternoon.
